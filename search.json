Until now, my studies and research have mainly focused on the evolution and development of plants. Currently, I am an EMBO postdoctoral researcher at the Università Degli Studi di Milano, working in Colombo’s lab, I received a ‘Seal of Excellence’ from the European commission after applying for the Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship. This position is a very exciting experience for me as I tackle the development of seeds in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. I obtained my PhD in June 2021, in a joint program between the City University of New York (CUNY) and the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) with Dr. Barbara Ambrose as my advisor. My doctoral research focused on ovule development of non-model species, particularly on gymnosperms, the first plant lineage where seeds evolved. Given the enormous morphological diversity of seeds, the project included five different species. This research also combined several approaches, such as morphology and anatomy, to describe the developmental stages of the seed in the species selected, and genomic approaches to compare the expression patterns of what is known from the model species Arabidopsis with gymnosperms. In addition, I have used different programming languages such as Bash, AWK and Python, that are of great help for analyzing the transcriptome data. I invite you to watch my predefense seminar available here. But it was during my undergraduate studies that I fell in love with the evolution and development of plants. Mentored by Prof. Natalia Pabon-Mora, my thesis dissertation was on the evolution of the APETALA2 gene lineage.\nSo far, my research has been the subject of various publications that I invite you to consult Do not hesitate to contact me,\nCecilia Zumajo-Cardona\nVia Celoria 26, Università degli Studi di Milano Milano, Italy.\ncecilia.zumajo@unimi.it"

    "title": "Evolution of the SPATULA/ALCATRAZ gene lineage and expression analyses in the basal eudicot, Bocconia frutescens L. (Papaveraceae)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: SPATULA (SPT) and ALCATRAZ (ALC) are recent paralogs that belong to the large bHLH transcription factor family. Orthologs of these genes have been found in all core eudicots, whereas pre-duplication genes, named paleoSPATULA/ALCATRAZ, have been found in basal eudicots, monocots, basal angiosperms and gymnosperms. Never- theless, functional studies have only been performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, where SPT and ALC are partially redundant in carpel and valve margin development and ALC has a unique role in the dehiscence zone. Further analyses of pre-duplication genes are necessary to assess the functional evolution of this gene lineage. Results: We isolated additional paleoSPT/ALC genes from Aristolochia fimbriata, Bocconia frutescens, Cattleya trianae and Hypoxis decumbens from our transcriptome libraries and performed phylogenetic analyses. We identified the previously described bHLH domain in all analyzed sequences and also new conserved motifs using the MEME suite. Finally, we analyzed the expression of three paleoSPT/ALC genes (BofrSPT1/2/3) from Bocconia frutescens, a basal eudicot in the Papaveraceae. To determine the developmental stages at which these genes were expressed, pre- and post-anthesis carpels and fruits of B. frutescens were collected, sectioned, stained, and examined using light micros- copy. Using in situ hybridization we detected that BofrSPT1/2/3 genes are expressed in floral buds, early sepal initiation, stamens and carpel primordia and later during fruit development in the dehiscence zone of the opercular fruit. Conclusions: Our expression results, in comparison with those available for core eudicots, suggest conserved roles of members of the SPT/ALC gene lineage across eudicots in the specification of carpel margins and the dehiscence zone of the mature fruits. Although there is some redundancy between ALC and SPT, these gene clades seem to have undergone some degree of sub-functionalization in the core eudicots, likely by changes in cis regulatory regions and to some extent in coding sequences, at least in Brassicaceae. Our results also indicate that in Bocconia frutescens, pale- oSPT/ALC genes may play a role in early floral organ specification that was subsequently lost in core eudicot lineages."

    "text": "Leaves constitute the main photosynthetic plant organ and even though their importance is not debated, the origin and development of leaves still is. The leaf developmental network has been elucidated for angiosperms, from genes controlling leaf initiation, to leaf polarity and shape. There are four KANADI (KAN) paralogs in Arabidopsis thaliana needed for organ polarity with KAN1 and KAN2 specifying abaxial leaf identity. Yet, studies of this gene lineage outside angiosperms are required to better understand the evolutionary patterns of leaf development and the role of KAN homologs. We studied the evolution of KAN genes across vascular plants and their expression by in situ hybridization in the fern, Equisetum hyemale and the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii. Our results show that the expression of KAN genes in leaves is similar between ferns and angiosperms. However, the expression patterns observed in the lycophyte S. moellendorffii are significantly different compared to all other vascular plants, suggesting that the KAN function in leaf polarity is likely only conserved across ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. This study indicates that mechanisms for leaf development are different in lycophytes compared to other vascular plants."

Recently, it has been reported that TT8, encoding a bHLH transcription factor, is involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in the seed coat and it also plays a role in bypassing the postzygotic barrier resulting from an unbalance in genetic loads of the parental lines. Here, we focus on the functional evolution, in seed development, of the bHLH proteins that are part of the MBW complex, complemented with a literature review.\n• Methods Phylogenetic analyses performed across seed plants and expression analyses in the reproductive tissues of four selected angiosperms (Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Capsella rubella and Solanum lycopersicum) allow us to hypothesize on the evolution of its functions.\n• Key Results TT8 expression in the innermost layer of the seed coat is conserved in the selected angiosperms. However, except for Arabidopsis, TT8 is also expressed in ovules, carpels and fruits. The homologues belonging to the sister clade of TT8, EGL3/GL3, involved in trichome development, are expressed in the outermost layer of the seed coat, suggesting potential roles in mucilage.\n• Conclusions The ancestral function of these genes appears to be flavonoid biosynthesis, and the conservation of TT8 expression patterns in the innermost layer of the seed coat in angiosperms suggests that their function in postzygotic barriers might also be conserved. Moreover, the literature review and the results of the present study suggest a sophisticated association, linking the mechanisms of action of these genes to the cross-communication activity between the different tissues of the seed. Thus, it provides avenues to study the mechanisms of action of TT8 in the postzygotic triploid block, which is crucial because it impacts seed development in unbalanced crosses."

Ginkgo biloba, with a unique place in plant evolution, being one of the first extant gymnosperms where seeds evolved, can testify to the evolution and development of the seed. Initially, to better understand the development of the ovules in Ginkgo biloba ovules, we performed spatio‐temporal expression analyses in seeds at early developing stages, of six candidate gene homologues known in angiosperms: WUSCHEL, AINTEGUMENTA, BELL1, KANADI, UNICORN, and C3HDZip.

Consistent with previous studies on early diverging seedless plant lineages, ferns, lycophytes, and bryophytes, many of these candidate genes are mainly expressed in mega‐ and microsporangia. Through in‐depth comparative transcriptome analyses of Ginkgo biloba developing ovules, pollen cones, and megagametophytes we have been able to identify novel genes, likely involved in ovule development.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The field of evolutionary developmental biology can help address how morphological novelties evolve, a key question in evolutionary biology. In Arabidopsis thaliana, APETALA2 (AP2) plays a role in the development of key plant innovations including seeds, flowers, and fruits. AP2 belongs to the AP2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING FACTOR family which has members in all viridiplantae, making it one of the oldest and most diverse gene lineages. One key subclade, present across vascular plants is the euAPETALA2 (euAP2) clade, whose founding member is AP2. We reconstructed the evolution of the euAP2 gene lineage in vascular plants to better understand its impact on the morphological evolution of plants, identifying seven major duplication events. We also performed spatiotemporal expression analyses of euAP2/TOE3 genes focusing on less explored vascular plant lineages, including ferns, gymnosperms, early diverging angiosperms and early diverging eudicots. Altogether, our data suggest that euAP2 genes originally contributed to spore and sporangium development, and were subsequently recruited to ovule, fruit and floral organ development. Finally, euAP2 protein sequences are highly conserved; therefore, changes in the role of euAP2 homologs during development are most likely due to changes in regulatory regions."

The ovules of these plant lineages are formed by a single massive integument that, as the ovule matures into a seed, is comprised of a stony layer covered by a fleshy seed coat. However, literature on their seed morphology and anatomy, which is key for understanding the evolution of land plants, is scarce and not easily accessible. Here we provide a literature review highlighting the diversity of ovule and megastrobilus morphologies. Additionally, we present further morphological and anatomical descriptions, making a comprehensive description of ovulated structures in Cycadales. In general, the integument is similar amongst these species, with three well differentiated zones: sarcotesta, sclerotesta and endotesta, from the outer most zone to the inner most zone. Cycad ovules have two sets of vascular bundles: one in the sarcotesta and another one in the region between the endotesta and the nucellus (i.e., the pachychalaza). However, Ginkgo does not have any vasculature in the ovule. Other differences between species that are mainly related with the number of cell layers and to the abundance and the location of ergastic substances."

The APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE ELEMENT- BINDING FACTOR (AP2/ERF) genes are exclusive to vascular plants and have been classified into the AP2-like and ERF-like clades. The AP2-like clade includes the AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) and the euAPETALA2 (euAP2) genes, both regulated by miR172.

We studied the evolution and expression patterns of euAP2/ TOE3 genes to assess large scale and local duplications and evaluate protein motifs likely related with functional changes across seed plants. We sampled euAP2/TOE3 genes from vascular plants and have found three major duplications and a few taxon-specific duplications. Here, we report conserved and new motifs across euAP2/ TOE3 proteins and conclude that proteins predating the Brassicaceae duplication are more similar to AP2 than TOE3. Expression data show a shift from restricted expression in leaves, carpels, and fruits in non-core eudicots and asterids to a broader expression of euAP2 genes in leaves, all floral organs and fruits in rosids. Altogether, our data show a functional trend where the canonical A-function (sepal and petal identity) is exclusive to Brassicaceae and it is likely not maintained outside of rosids."

The genetics involved in ovule development have been well studied in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, which has two integuments and anatropous orientation. This study is approached from what is known in arabidopsis, focusing on the expression patterns of homologues of four genes known to be key for the proper development of the integuments in arabidopsis: AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), BELL1, (BEL1), KANADIs (KANs) and UNICORN (UCN).\n• Methods We used histology to describe the morphoanatomical development from ovules to seeds in Gnetum gnemon. We carried out spatiotemporal expression analyses in G. gnemon, a gymnosperm, which has a unique ovule morphology with an integument covering the nucellus, two additional envelopes where the outermost becomes fleshy as the seed matures, and an orthotropous orientation.\n• Key Results Our anatomical and developmental descriptions provide a framework for expression analyses in the ovule of G. gnemon. Our expression results show that although ANT, KAN and UCN homologues are expressed in the inner integument, their spatiotemporal patterns differ from those found in angiosperms. Furthermore, all homologues studied here are expressed in the nucellus, revealing major differences in seed plants. Finally, no expression of the studied homologues was detected in the outer envelopes.\n• Conclusions Altogether, these analyses provide significant comparative data that allows us to better understand the functional evolution of these gene lineages, providing a compelling framework for evolutionary and develop- mental studies of seeds. Our findings suggest that these genes were most likely recruited from the sporangium development network and became restricted to the integuments of angiosperm ovules."

Arabidopsis thaliana, a model eudicot, has a dry bicarpellate silique, when the fruit matures, the two valves fall apart through the dehiscence zone leaving the seeds attached to the remaining medial tissue, called the replum. Proper replum development in A. thaliana is mediated by REPLUMLESS (RPL), a TALE Homeodomain protein. RPL represses the valve margin genetic program and the downstream dehiscence zone formation in the medial tissue of the siliques and RPL orthologs have conserved roles across the Brassicaceae eudicots. A RPL homolog, qSH1, has been studied in rice, a monocot, and plays a role in fruit shedding making it difficult to predict functional evolution of this gene lineage across angiosperms. Although RPL orthologs have been identified across all angiosperms, expression and functional analyses are scarce. In order to fill the phylogenetic gap between the Brassicaceae and monocots we have characterized the expression patterns of RPL homologs in two poppies with different fruit types, Bocconia frutescens with operculate valvate dehiscence and a persistent medial tissue, similar to a replum, and Papaver somniferum, a poppy with persistent medial tissue in between the multicarpellate gynoecia. We found that RPL homologs in Papaveraceae have broad expression patterns during plant development; in the shoot apical meristem, during flowering transition and in many floral organs, especially the carpels. These patterns are similar to those of RPL in A. thaliana. However, our results suggest that RPL does not have conserved roles in the maintenance of medial persistent tissues of fruits but may be involved with establishing the putative dehiscence zone in dry poppy fruits."

In some angiosperm species, despite the imbalance between maternally and paternally inherited chromosome sets, crosses between parental lines of different ploidy may result in viable offspring. However, many plant species, like Arabidopsis thaliana, present a post‐zygotic reproductive barrier, known as triploid block which results in the inability of crosses between individuals of different ploidy to generate viable seeds but also, in defective development of the seed. Several paternal regulators have been proposed as active players in establishing the triploid block. Maternal regulators known to be involved in this process are some flavonoid biosynthetic (FB) genes, expressed in the innermost layer of the seed coat. Here we explore the role of selected flavonoid pathway genes in triploid block, including TRANSPARENT TESTA 4 (TT4), TRANSPARENT TESTA 7 (TT7), SEEDSTICK (STK), TRANSPARENT TESTA 16 (TT16), TT8 and TRANSPARENT TESTA 13 (TT13). This approach allowed us to detect that TT8, a bHLH transcription factor, member of this FB pathway is required for the paternal genome dosage, as loss of function tt8, leads to complete rescue of the triploid block to seed development."
